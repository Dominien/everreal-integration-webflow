# Item Deletion Functionality Summary

## Implementation Highlights

- Added robust detection of DELETE flag in XML files
- Implemented multiple deletion methods with fallbacks:
  - WebflowClient.collections.items.deleteItem (primary)
  - WebflowClient.collections.items.remove (fallback 1)
  - Direct axios API call (ultimate fallback)
- Enhanced logging for easier troubleshooting
- Improved item matching to find properties regardless of field structure
- Added proper error handling for all API operations

## Testing

Created multiple test scripts:
- test-xml-delete.js: Tests XML parsing and DELETE flag detection
- test-delete.js: Tests just the Webflow item deletion functionality
- direct-delete-test.js: Tests deletion using direct API calls
- test-delete-integration.js: Tests the full import and delete flow

## API Compatibility

The implementation is compatible with:
- Webflow API v1 and v2 endpoints
- Various WebflowClient library versions
- Different formats of item data returned by Webflow
